# SimHub-StreamDeck-GearDisplay
A SimHub Ncalc file and Stream Deck profile that create a rudimentary gear display for your sim racing setup

## Dependencies (Install these first)

- [SimHub Property Server](https://github.com/pre-martin/SimHubPropertyServer) by pre-martin
- [Stream Deck SimHub Plugin](https://github.com/pre-martin/StreamDeckSimHubPlugin) by pre-martin

## Installation

- Put the INI file in the NCalcScripts subdirectory in your SimHub directory
- Double click the .streamdeckprofile file to install

## Limitations
Right now, this does R, N, and 1-6. If you drive one of those high geared jobbies, this'll take a little bit more work.
